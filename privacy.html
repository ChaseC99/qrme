        <h2>In-App Purchases</h2>
        <p>
            To handle in-app purchases, an anonymous user ID is created when you first launch the Application.
            No personal information about you is revealed to the Service Provider through this user ID. 
            If you choose to make an in-app purchase, the subscription status will be stored on your user ID along with any transaction identifiers associated with the payments. 
            However, the Service Provider does not have access to any of your payment information as Apple Inc. (on iOS) or Google LLC (on Android) will be processing all the payments.
        </p>
